# How AI Works ðŸ¤–

This repository explains **how artificial intelligence works** in simple terms, with code examples and diagrams.

## ðŸ”¹ What is AI
AI (Artificial Intelligence) are programs that can solve tasks requiring "intelligent" behavior:
- Recognizing text, images, and speech
- Answering questions
- Playing games and making predictions
- Recommendations (YouTube, TikTok, Netflix)

## ðŸ”¹ How a Neural Network Works
1. **Input** â€” text, image, or sound  
2. **Processing (Neural Network)** â€” the network finds patterns in the data  
3. **Output** â€” answer, image, or action

## ðŸ”¹ Types of AI
- **Machine Learning (ML)** â€” learns from data, predicts outcomes  
- **Deep Learning (DL)** â€” large neural networks for complex tasks  
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** â€” works with text and language

## ðŸ”¹ AI Applications
- Chatbots and virtual assistants  
- Video/music recommendations  
- Face and object recognition  
- Autonomous vehicles

## ðŸ”¹ Code Examples
- Python: `examples/text-generation.py`  
- Python: `examples/image-classification.py`  
- JS: `examples/chatbot.js`
